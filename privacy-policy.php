						<p class="def-p-title">1. Introduction</p>
						<p class="def-p">Bitcoin allows any bank, business or individual to securely send and receive payments anywhere at any time, with or without a bank account. Bitcoin is available in a large number of countries that still remain 	out of reach for most payment systems due to their own limitations. Bitcoin increases global access to commerce and it can help international trades to flourish.</p>
